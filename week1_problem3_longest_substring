Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. 
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. 
For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
