"""
Write a program to calculate the credit card balance after one year if a person only pays the minimum monthly payment 
required by the credit card company each month.

The following variables contain values as described below:

balance - the outstanding balance on the credit card

annualInterestRate - annual interest rate as a decimal

monthlyPaymentRate - minimum monthly payment rate as a decimal

For each month, calculate statements on the monthly payment and remaining balance. 
At the end of 12 months, print out the remaining balance.

Monthly interest rate= (Annual interest rate) / 12.0
Minimum monthly payment = (Minimum monthly payment rate) x (Previous balance)

Monthly unpaid balance = (Previous balance) - (Minimum monthly payment)

Updated balance each month = (Monthly unpaid balance) + (Monthly interest rate x Monthly unpaid balance)
"""

i = 1
b = balance
for i in range(1,13):
    p = b * (monthlyPaymentRate)
    ub = b - p
    b = ub + (annualInterestRate/12)*ub
    i += 1
print(round(b, 2))
